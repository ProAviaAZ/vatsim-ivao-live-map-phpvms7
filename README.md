# VATSIM + IVAO Live Map for phpVMS 7

Version: **4.6.3** (2026-04-04)

Interactive live map widget for phpVMS 7 with VATSIM/IVAO traffic, FIR/UIR sectors, VA flight panels, weather overlays, and an admin-driven configuration module.

## Highlights

- Dual-network map: VATSIM + IVAO pilots/controllers
- FIR + UIR sector rendering from VATSpy data
- VA Active + Planned flights panel with mobile layout support
- Multi-flight follow mode (fit all active aircraft)
- OpenWeatherMap server-side proxy (API key stays server-side)
- Admin settings page (`/admin/livemap`) for layout, weather, network, mobile, colors
- Mobile cleanup: single mobile **Flights** button + separate Network side tab
- Simplified color system: only 3 admin colors (Primary, Accent, Box Background)

## Package Contents

This repository ships two deployable parts:

1. `LiveMap/` (phpVMS module)
2. `live_map.blade.php` (theme widget template)

For convenience, versioned full packages contain both, for example:

- `LiveMap-full-package-20260404-xxxxxx-v4.6.3.zip`

## Installation (No SSH)

This release should be installed as a **full package** because module logic and blade/widget files were updated together.

1. Extract the latest versioned full package (example: `LiveMap-full-package-20260404-xxxxxx-v4.6.3.zip`).
2. Copy `LiveMap/` to your phpVMS root under `Modules/LiveMap`.
3. Copy these three files to your active theme widget path:
   - `live_map.blade.php`
   - `live_map_styles.blade.php`
   - `live_map_scripts.blade.php`
   For example:
   - `resources/views/layouts/SPTheme/widgets/live_map.blade.php`
   - `resources/views/layouts/Disposable_v3/widgets/live_map.blade.php`
4. Open your phpVMS update endpoint in the browser:
   - `/update`
5. Open **Admin -> Live Map** and save settings once.
6. In phpVMS Admin, run **Clear Caches**.

No SSH/CLI commands are required.

## Upgrade Notes

- If you update from older releases, deploy `LiveMap/` and all three widget files (`live_map.blade.php`, `live_map_styles.blade.php`, `live_map_scripts.blade.php`) to avoid UI/config mismatches.
- Hard refresh browser cache after deploy (`Ctrl+F5`).

## Critical phpVMS Setting Note (Important)

`ACARS -> Live Time` should be **1 or greater**.

Do **not** set `Live Time = 0` on production systems.

Reason: in phpVMS core, this setting is also used by automated stale/stuck PIREP cleanup and cancellation logic. Setting it to `0` can interfere with that housekeeping flow.

Recommended baseline:

| Setting | Recommended | Why |
|---|---:|---|
| Center Coords | `51.1657,10.4515` | Example center for Germany |
| Default Zoom | `5` | Regional overview |
| Live Time | `1` | Keeps phpVMS cleanup behavior safe |
| Refresh Interval | `60` | Stable update interval |

## Weather Proxy

When **Enable server-side weather proxy** is ON:

- OpenWeatherMap key is stored server-side
- browser DevTools does not expose the key
- tile failures can be handled with blank fallback tiles to avoid 502 spam

Admin page also shows:

- proxy status
- last OWM error code
- short troubleshooting hint

## Mobile Behavior

Current mobile behavior is intentionally minimal:

- One floating button: **Flights**
- Network control remains in the side/bottom Network panel (no extra green network floating button)
- Admin options control default open/closed states for Flights/Weather/Network sections

## Colors (Reduced)

Admin color settings were simplified to:

1. **Primary UI Color**
2. **Accent UI Color**
3. **Box Background Color**

Mapping:

- Primary: Weather/Network headers, Flights header start, mobile Flights button inactive
- Accent: Flights header end, mobile Flights button active
- Box Background: body area of flights/weather/network panels

## Security

- External API output is sanitized before DOM rendering
- Weather key can be protected server-side via proxy mode
- See `SECURITY.md` for policy and reporting

## Compatibility

- phpVMS 7 (current maintained branches)
- Themes: SPTheme, Disposable_v3 (and any theme using compatible widget path)

## Release Files

- `CHANGELOG.md` -> full change history
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md` -> current release summary for GitHub release text

Use versioned ZIP file names to avoid browser/CDN cache confusion with generic names.
